		<h1>Exploring Mitosis</h1>
		<p>
			In cell biology, mitosis (/maɪˈtoʊsɪs/) is a part of 
			the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are 
			separated into two new nuclei. In general, mitosis 
			(division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage 
			of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) 
			and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis, 
			which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane 
			into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of 
			these cellular components.[1] Mitosis and cytokinesis 
			together define the mitotic (M) phase of an animal cell 
			cycle—the division of the mother cell into two daughter 
			cells genetically identical to each other.
